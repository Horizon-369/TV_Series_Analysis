# Analyze your favourite Series with NLP
In this project we are going to analyze a series with NLP and LLMs. We are going to scrape our own dataset, use zero shot classifiers, build our own LLM text classifier, use NER to build a character network and build a charatecter chatbot to chat with your favorite characters. And in the end we are going to put all that in web GUI with Gradio. This NLP project will take your CV to another level. You will learn a lot of NLP skills that is used in the market.

## Overview
In this project, we have created 5 models, each containing the code for a different part of the project:

crawler: This folder contains the code for web scraping the internet to build a comprehensive dataset about the anime using Scrapy.

character_network: This folder contains the code for creating an intricate character network using Spacy's NER model, NetworkX, and PyViz.

text_classifier: This folder contains the code for training a text classifier that can classify text into multiple classes.

theme_classifier: This folder contains the code for extracting the main themes of the series using Zero-shot classifiers.

charater_chat_bot: This folder contains the code for building a charatcer chatbot with LLMs to chat with your favorite charaters from the series.
